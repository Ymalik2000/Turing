# Turing

A place for me to store my numerous projects made in Turing. 

Grade 10 involves a few very basic programs, while Grade 11 involves many more programs with increased complexity.

The Assignments folder contains the important and more complex programs I have made, while Exercises contains practice programs I used to learn crucial concepts.

An exemplar of my work is an animated birthday card, found under Ymalik2000/Turing/Grade 11/Assignments/Birthday Card/Birthday_Card_Final_Yash_Malik.t

Feel free to add comments and suggestions!
