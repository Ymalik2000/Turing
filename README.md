# Turing

A place for me to store my numerous projects made in Turing. 

Grade 10 involves a few very basic programs, while Grade 11 involves many more programs with increased complexity.

The Assignments folder contains the important and more complex programs I have made, while the latter contains practice programs I used to learn crucial concepts.
